# WooCommerce Edit Order Numbers

Manually edit WooCommerce order numbers.

This plugin allows WooCommerce administrators to manually edit existing order numbers. It is intended to be paired with the UltimateWoo Sequential Order Numbers module or the Sequential Order Numbers plugin but it will work without any additional plugin.

To edit an order number, view the WooCommerce Orders page. The plugin adds a new column to the table list view where you can enter a custom order number. Once you update the order number, it will begin displaying in the order information (admin and frontend).
